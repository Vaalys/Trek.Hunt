## Functionality
Meets Expectations. There are some issues with functionality however. The search function is a pretty buggy. I'm not entirely sure the purpose of My treks as well. I think you have big plans for this application and I encourage you to polish the functionality of this application prior to your portfolio review.

## User Interface
Meets Expectations. I really like the design of the page. Although some transparency in the middle div would be dope you could see the whole picture. I think it's relatively intuitive what your supposed to do with it. I think this is closely tied with the functionality; however, and would like to see the final version of this application when you move forward with it.

## Maintainability/Code Quality
Does not meet expectations. No comments! Commenting code is a must. Not only for other programmers looking at your code, but for future you. There seems to be a lot of unneccessary code in places. You also mentioned in your self assessment that you noticed your javascript was all over the place. Which it makes it really hard to figure out where the bugs are in your script! Try to implement OOJS to your application, it may tidy things up greatly. I would say definitely refactor at the very least. This is an area where you could greatly improve upon with just a couple hours of refactoring/commenting.

## Evidence of Comprehension
Meets Expectations. This was kind of a hard category for me to guage. It seems you are thinking in all the right places. However, I have no basis for which to judge your comprehension of the backend(ie server side comprehension). I like that you utilized user auth and an external server, but your usage of the internal database is minimal. I think moving forward with your idea, to store activities and locations, you will want a much bigger domain than you currently have. Start thinking about how you want to flesh this app out. I would definitely encourage you to polish this application prior to the meet and greet.
